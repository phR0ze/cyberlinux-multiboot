# Usage <a name="grub2-bootloader"/></a>

## Install prerequisites <a name="install-prerequisites"/></a>
**For building grub boot images:**
```bash
$ sudo pacman -S arch-install-scripts grub libisoburn
```

**For testing grub boot images:**
```bash
$ sudo pacman -S virtualbox virtualbox-host-modules-arch
```

## Create multiboot USB <a name="create-multiboot-usb"/></a>
We need to create a bootable USB that will work on older BIOS systems as well as the newer UEFI
systems so make this as universal as possible.

# GRUB2 bootloader <a name="grub2-bootloader"/></a>
[GRUB2](https://www.gnu.org/software/grub) offers the ability to easily create a bootable USB drive
for both BIOS and UEFI systems as well as a customizable menu for arbitrary payloads. This
combination is ideal for a customizable initramfs based installer. Using GRUB2 we can boot on any
system with a custom splash screen and menus and then launch our initramfs installer which will
contain the tooling necessary to install the system. After which the initramfs installer will reboot
the system into the newly installed OS.

### GRUB2 configuration <a name="grub2-configuration"/></a>
GRUB2 is configured via its 

### GFXMenu module <a name="gfxmenu-module"/></a>
The [gfxmenu](https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub-dev/html_node/Introduction_005f2.html#Introduction_005f2)
module provides a graphical menu interface for GRUB 2. It functions as an alternative to the menu
interface provided by the `normal` module. The graphical menu uses the GRUB video API supporting
VESA BIOS extensions (VBE) 2.0+ and supports a number of GUI components.

`gfxmenu` supports a container-based layout system. Components can be added to containers, and
containers (which are a type of component) can then be added to other containers, to form a tree of
components. The root component of the tree is a `canvas` component, which allows manual layout of its
child components.

**Non-container components**:
* `label`
* `image`
* `progress_bar`
* `circular_progress`
* `list`

**Container components**:
* `canvas`
* `hbox`
* `vbox`

The GUI component instances are created by the theme loader in `gfxmenu/theme_loader.c` when a them
is loaded.


# Installer <a name="installer"/></a>
**Goals:** *boot speed*, *simplicity*, and *automation*

Installing Linux on a target system typically consists of booting into a full live system and then
launch a full GUI with wizard to walk you through the installtion process. The downsides of this are
it takes a long time to boot into the live system and it isn't well suited for automating an install
process. The other method which I'll use for `cyberlinux` is a minimal graphical environment that
launches from a pre-boot environment. Fedora's Anaconda or Ubuntu's minimal ncurses based installers
are examples of this. The concept is to build an early user space image typically known as an
`initramfs` that will contain enough tooling to setup and install your system.


## initramfs installer <a name="initramfs-installer"/></a>
The initial ramdisk is in essence a very small environment (a.k.a early userspace) which contains
customizable tooling and instructions to load kernel modules as needed to set up necessary things
before handing over control to `init`. We can leverage this early userspace to build a custom install
environment containing all the tooling required to setup our system.

### Create initramfs installer <a name="create-initramfs-installer"/></a>
An initramfs is made by creating a `cpio` archive, which is an old simple archive format comparable
to tar. This archive is then compressed using `gzip`.
